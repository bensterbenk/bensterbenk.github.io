    <h1>Hi! I’m Ben Sterbenk, a Senior undergraduate student at Ithaca College pursuing a double BA in Legal Studies and Computer Science. </h1>
    <h3>
      As an undergraduate, I've fallen in love with the intersection of my two majors. In my opinion, the application of technology to policiy and law is of vital importance in our rapidly evolving world. 
    </h3>

    <h2>
      I’ve created: 
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A variety of coding projects in and out of class, in the process gaining experience of full-stack web development, Machine Learning Python, C++, JavaScript, and Java. To see these projects, you can click on the github icon on the left.</p>

    <h2>
And had other amazing experiences like:
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p>
Studying computer science at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, where I had the opportunity to learn about the intersection between computer science and audiovisual perception, as well as to advance my knowledge on Machine Learning and C++ development.

      Founding and serving as Co-President of the Ithaca College Music & Production Club, where I organized an amazing community of creatives, videographers, and musicians. Since our founding in 2024, we've grown significantly and created amazing projects such as a group album, music videos, a cohesive social media prescence, and a variety of social events. Independently of the club, I've spent college engaging with the vibrant artistic community of Ithaca by producing and engineering songs for talented local student artists at Cornell University and Ithaca College and developiing soundtracks for film students.
