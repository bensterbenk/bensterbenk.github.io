    <h1>Hi! I’m Ben Sterbenk, a 3rd year undergraduate student at Ithaca College pursuing a double BA in Legal Studies and Computer Science. </h1>
    <h3>
      I’m fascinated by the ways we can use the power of technology to advance legal, humanitarian, and creative development. In my opinion, the application of tech and computer science to the humanities and arts is of vital importance in our rapidly evolving world.

    <h2>
      During my time at Ithaca College:

    <h3>
      I’ve created: 
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A variety of coding projects in and out of class, in the process gaining experience of full-stack web development, Python, C++, JavaScript, and Java. To see these projects, you can click on the github icon on the left.</p>

        </a>
    </li>
      <li>
        <p>Essays, research papers and written arguments which expanded my abilities as a writer and thinker in my humanities coursework and in various other contexts. To read some of my work, you can click the book on the right.</p>

    </ul>
    <h3>
And had other amazing experiences like:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p>
Studying computer science at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, where I had the opportunity to learn about the intersection between computer science and audiovisual perception, as well as to advance my knowledge on Machine Learning and C++ development.
